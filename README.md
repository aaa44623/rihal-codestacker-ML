# Rihal CodeStacker

Welcome to the 2024 CodeStacker Challenge! This unique challenge series is designed to test and enhance your skills across three core domains of software development: Frontend, Backend, and Machine Learning. Whether you're a beginner looking to get hands-on experience, an intermediate developer seeking to solidify your knowledge, or an advanced professional aiming to tackle new challenges, CodeStacker offers something for everyone.


# Challenges

## 1. Frontend Challenge
For the Frontend Challenge, we're focusing on the power and flexibility of React. Your task is to create a responsive and interactive web application using React. This challenge will test your ability to create React components, manage state, handle events, and integrate with APIs. Show off your creativity and problem-solving skills to build an engaging and dynamic user experience.

## 2. Backend Challenge
The Backend Challenge puts your server-side knowledge to the test. Develop a robust backend system that can handle data efficiently, manage user authentication, and ensure secure API endpoints. Use any backend technology stack like such as Node.js, Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails, etc..., to architect a scalable application.

## 3. Machine Learning Challenge
Step into the realm of artificial intelligence with our Machine Learning Challenge. Implement a machine learning model to solve a specific problem, ranging from image recognition to predictive analytics. You're encouraged to use libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn to design, train, and evaluate your model.
