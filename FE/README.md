# Frontend Challenge


### Overview
Calling all developers! Get ready to embark on an exciting journey into the world of Pok√©mon with our Frontend Challenge. This challenge is designed to test your ability to create a nicely structured web application that is scalable and easy to maintain, <b>using React</b>.

### Required Features

1. Utilize the https://pokeapi.co/ API to retrieve necessary Pok√©mon information. Show details like image, name, number, types, and stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Speed) and a preview of its evolution.
2. Implement smooth pagination to fetch 20 Pok√©mon at a time. Keep the adventure going as users explore more Pok√©mon effortlessly.
3. Cache your API calls to minimize redundant queries for Pok√©mon data.
4. Ensure that selecting a Pok√©mon updates the URL route dynamically, facilitating easy sharing of specific Pok√©mon profiles.

#### Example:

When a user lands on the app's homepage, they see a list of Pok√©mon with their details like image, name and weight. They can navigate through pages using pagination. Upon clicking on a Pok√©mon, such as "Bulbasaur," the URL updates dynamically to reflect the selected Pok√©mon's information. Simultaneously, the app fetches and displays more detailed data about Bulbasaur, such as its type, stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Speed) and a preview of its evolution.
Subsequently, if the user clicks on one of Bulbasaur's evolutions, representing another Pok√©mon, the application promptly displays the pertinent details for the selected Pok√©mon, providing a continuous and informative user experience.

### Tips for Success
We want to see your skills shine! Here are some pointers to help you ace this challenge:
- Clear separation of state logic is required, achieved through hooks or the context API.
- Use functional components for a clean and efficient codebase. Show us your mastery of React's latest features.
- Impress us with your clean, well-structured code. Follow best practices, separate concerns, and showcase your design patterns.
- Set up the project with Prettier and ESLint for consistent code formatting.
- Git is your friend! Use it throughout your development journey.

### Bonus Points
Want to go above and beyond? Here are some extra challenges to level up your solution:
- Implementation in TypeScript.
- Enhance your application's aesthetics and functionality by incorporating a UI components library.
- Dockerize the application.
- Take it a step further by deploying your application in the cloud and providing a shareable link for easy access.
