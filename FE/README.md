# Frontend Challenge


### Overview
The challenge is to create a nicely structured web application that is scalable and easy to maintain, using React. The app should list Pokémon numbers and names and display basic information about the selected Pokémon, including an image, name, types, stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Speed), and a preview of its evolution.

### Required Features

1. Utilize the https://pokeapi.co/ API to retrieve necessary Pokémon information.
2. Implement pagination to fetch 20 Pokémon at a time when the user requests more or the next group of Pokémon.
3. Cache your API calls to minimize redundant queries for Pokémon data.
4. Ensure that selecting a Pokémon updates the URL route so that users can share the link.

### Some Pointers

- You don’t have to use Redux, a clear separation of state logic is required, achieved through hooks or the context API.
- Use functional components.
- Emphasize clean code, separation of concerns, and the thoughtful use of design patterns.
- Set up the project with Prettier and ESLint for consistent code formatting.
- Adhere to best practices for version control using Git.

### Extra Points

- Implementation in TypeScript.
- Incorporate a UI components library.
- Dockerize the application.
- Deploy the application in the cloud and provide a shareable link.

### Delivery Instructions
1. Create a private GitHub repo
2. Grant the following GitHub accounts access to your repository:
